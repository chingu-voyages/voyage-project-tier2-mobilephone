## Overview

Welcome, Chingu Data Scientists!

Who doesn't like movies? We are lucky to live in a time where we have easy
access to thousands of movies in many different categories or genres.

But, there are so many it's difficult to understand which movies are the most
popular and to discover trends in the movie industry.

In this voyage, your team will analyze a massive set of movies and reviews by
critics to display the most popular ones. Due to the sheer volume of data to
be processed you'll need to pay special attention to performance.

Happy viewing!

## General Instructions

This project is designed to be worked on by a team rather than an individual
Chingu. This means you and your team will need to thoroughly read and
understand the requirements and specifications below, **_and_** define and
manage your project following the _Agile Methodology_ defined in the
[Voyage Handbook](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/guides/voyage/voyage.md#voyage-guide).

As you create this project make sure it meets all of the requirements, but once
it reaches MVP, start implementing the optional features or get creative and
extend it in ways we haven't envisioned. In other words, use the power of
teamwork to make it distinctive and unique.

Take note that we haven't given specific direction on what your UI/UX should
look like or how results are to be rendered. This is another area where you
and your team can put your creativity to work!

## Requirements & Specifications

### What You Need to Do

The following define the minimum requirements and ideas for features you may
implement to enhance this app, if time permits.

#### Structure

- [ ] You may use any languages, tools, or libraries you prefer when designing and building this app.
- [ ] You may build a Web application for your users or you may use a DS tool like Jupyter.
- [ ] You may **_NOT_** use AI-base solution generators like GitHub CoPilot.
- [ ] We've included a JSON files containing the raw data in the /assets directory in this repo. However, these are extremely large files so you'll need to pay attention to performance.
- [ ] Useful links and resources:
  - This data was obtained from the Kaggle dataset [üé¨üìΩÔ∏èThe MOTHER OF ALL MOVIE REVIEW DATASETS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/rotten-tomatoes-9800-movie-critic-and-user-reviews)

#### Styling

- [ ] Surprise us!!! Use your teams creativity to make this app distinctive.
- [ ] Be sure to add a link to your teams GitHub repo.
- [ ] Include an attribution to the data source you solution is based on.
- [ ] If you are developing a Web app you may find these resources helpful"
  - In general, you will find these [UI design principles](https://www.justinmind.com/ui-design/principles) helpful.
  - Recommend using this resource for [clean CSS](https://israelmitolu.hashnode.dev/writing-cleaner-css-using-bem-methodology).

#### Functionality

-   Overview
    - [ ] Analyze the movies dataset and display a summary of the most popular movies.

-   Basic Functionality
    - [ ] Fetch movie data from the provided JSON files in this [Google Drive directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17cGnwfhFg3HA2e7wJLmyqGh0ue1JANWY?usp=sharing).
    - [ ] Analyze the data to identify the most popular movies by these categories:
      - Most popular 100 movies of all time
      - Most popular 100 movies by critic score
      - Most popular 100 movies by combined critic & audience score
    - [ ] For each analysis include the appropriate summary metrics such as range of scores, mean score, average score, standard deviation, and any other metric you find to be useful.
    - [ ] You should also include data visualizations of your choice to add value to the results. For example, a graph of the most popular 100 movies by critic plotted by some range of scores.
    - [ ] The metrics and visualizations you create should be clearly labelled and organized in a way that makes it easy for the user to understand what they are.
    - [ ] Make sure that your results are displayed in manner that's easy for the user to interpret.

-   User Interface and Experience

    - [ ] Ensure the application provides a seamless user experience.
    - [ ] Implement intuitive UI/UX elements to guide users through the process of displaying your results.
    - [ ] Use responsive design techniques to ensure the application is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.

### Extras (Not Required)

- [ ] Implement filters and search functionality to easily find specific sets of results.
- [ ] Implement analytics for additional categories of data such as the following, or any other ones you think are useful or interesting to the user:
  - Most popular 100 movies by year of release
  - Most popular 100 movies by rating
  - Most popular 100 movies by critic score
  - Most popular 100 movies by audience score
  - 100 movies with the widest variation between critic and audience score

## Acceptance Criteria

- Basic Functionality

  - [ ] The analysis should meet the Basic functionality described above.
  - [ ] Your analysis should be performant. In other words, end users should be able to display the results in a reasonable amount of time (e.g. less than 10 seconds)
  - [ ] Users should be able to view the menu in an organized manner, with categories clearly delineated.

- User Interface and Experience

  - [ ] The application must provide an intuitive and seamless user experience for browsing the menu and placing orders.
  - [ ] Responsive design techniques must be used to ensure functionality across various devices and screen sizes.
